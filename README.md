# MIDAI

## Cloning Repository

When cloning the repository, you might want to clone the main branch only because the midi branch is only storing midi resources and take up a lot of space
Therefore use the following command:
> git clone -b main --single-branch https://github.com/Tjerbor/MIDAI.git

## Requirements

- Python 3
- [FluidSynth](https://www.fluidsynth.org/)
- [SoX - Sound eXchange](https://sox.sourceforge.net/)
